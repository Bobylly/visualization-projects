# visualization-projects
In here you'll find some examples of visualization tools that I'm using:
tableau, power-bi, excel, kibana, graphana, etc.
Every picture is documented (click the details), so navigating them shouldn't be streight forward.
Most of them are related to my favorite project I've been working at, in the last couple of years.
