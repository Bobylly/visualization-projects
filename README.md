# visualization-projects
In here you'll find some examples of visualization tools that I'm using:
tableau, power-bi, excel, kibana, graphana, etc.

Every picture is documented (click the details), so navigating them should be streight forward.

Most of them are related to my favorite project I've been working at, in the last couple of years.
Since the project is not open source, i'm only uploading some examples in hopes of helping others visualize what a data analyst does on a daily basis.
